Java Course for Software Testers (SDET) - From Zero Knowledge
---

Welcome to the world of automation! This guide is structured to get you from absolute zero knowledge to having a fully functional Java development environment, ready to write your first test automation code.

# Phase 1: Setting up the Foundation (Java JDK)

Java Development Kit (JDK) is the essential component that allows your computer to compile and run Java code. We'll use a widely supported version, such as **Java 17 (LTS)**.

## 1.1. Why Java for Testers?

Java is the backbone of many enterprise applications, and its robust nature makes it the most popular language for test automation frameworks (like Selenium, Rest Assured, and Cucumber).

## 1.2. Windows Setup Guide

### Step 1: Download the JDK Installer

Go to the official Oracle JDK download page (or use OpenJDK distribution like Adoptium).

Select the latest LTS (Long-Term Support) version (e.g., Java 17 or 21).

Choose the Windows tab and download the x64 Installer (.exe file).

### Step 2: Run the Installation

- Double-click the downloaded .exe file.

- Follow the on-screen prompts (accept the defaults). Note the installation directory (usually C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-{version}).

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables (Crucial!)

Java needs to be accessible from any command line location.

Search for "Environment Variables" in the Windows search bar and select "Edit the system environment variables".

ðŸ‘‰ Click the "Environment Variables..." button.

*Set JAVA_HOME:*

In the System variables section, click New....

ðŸ‘‰ Variable name: JAVA_HOME

Variable value: The path to your JDK installation (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17).

ðŸ‘‰ Update Path:

In the System variables section, find the Path variable and double-click it.

Click New and add %JAVA_HOME%\bin.

Click OK to close all windows.

### Step 4: Verification

Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

Type: ```java -version```


If the version numbers are displayed, the setup is successful!

## 1.3. macOS Setup Guide

### Step 1: Download the JDK Installer

Go to the official Oracle JDK download page or Adoptium.

ðŸ‘‰ Select the latest LTS version (e.g., Java 17).

Choose the macOS tab and download the ARM installer (for M1/M2/M3 chips) or x64 installer (for Intel chips). The file will be a .dmg.

### Step 2: Run the Installation

Double-click the downloaded .dmg file.

Double-click the .pkg file inside and follow the installation prompts.

### Step 3: Verification

Open a new Terminal window.

Type: ```java -version```

Type: ```javac -version```

If the version numbers are displayed, the setup is successful. macOS often handles the environment path automatically.

# Phase 2: Setting up the Build Tool (Maven)

Maven is a project management tool. It handles dependencies (the external libraries like Selenium that your project needs) and builds your project (compiles code, runs tests).

## 2.1. Why Maven for Testers?

It standardizes project structure and manages all required dependencies automatically using a single file (`pom.xml`). This is non-negotiable for professional testing frameworks.

## 2.2. Windows Setup Guide

### Step 1: Download Maven

Go to the official Apache Maven website.

Download the binary zip archive (e.g., **apache-maven-3.9.6-bin.zip**).

Extract the contents of the zip file to a simple location, like C:\Maven\apache-maven-3.9.6.

### Step 2: Set Environment Variables

ðŸ‘‰ Search for "Environment Variables" again.

Set M2_HOME:

In System variables, click New....

Variable name: M2_HOME

Variable value: The path to your Maven folder (e.g., C:\Maven\apache-maven-3.9.6).

Update Path:

Find the Path variable and double-click it.

Click New and add %M2_HOME%\bin.

Click OK.

### Step 3: Verification

Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

Type: mvn -version

You should see the Apache Maven version details.

## 2.3. macOS Setup Guide (Recommended: Homebrew)

### Step 1: Install Homebrew (If you don't have it)

Homebrew is the package manager for macOS. Open Terminal and run:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh))"
```

### Step 2: Install Maven

In Terminal, run the command:
```
brew install maven
```

### Step 3: Verification

In Terminal, run the command:
```
mvn -version
```

You should see the Apache Maven version details.

# Phase 3: Setting up the IDE and Project (IntelliJ IDEA)

The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is where you will write, organize, and debug your code. IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition is the industry standard and perfect for testers.

## 3.1. Download and Install IntelliJ

Go to the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA website.

Download the Community Edition (this is the free version and is all you need for test automation).

Run the installer for your OS and follow the default prompts.

## 3.2. Create Your First Maven Java Project

This is the moment where everything comes together!

### Step 1: Start a New Project

Open IntelliJ IDEA.

Select New Project.

Configure the settings:

Name: LT2510

Location: Choose a folder on your computer.

Language: Java

Build System: Maven (Crucial: Select this to use the pom.xml structure).

JDK: Select the JDK version you installed (e.g., 17). If it's not listed, click Add JDK... and point it to your JDK path (e.g., C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17).

Click Create.

### Step 2: Examine the Project Structure

IntelliJ and Maven create a standard folder structure:

**src/main/java**: For your main application code (we will mostly ignore this).

**src/test/java**: This is where you will write all your test automation code (Selenium, JUnit, etc.).

**pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file where you declare dependencies (libraries).

### Step 3: Write and Run Your First Code

Navigate to the `src/main/java` folder.

You will see a file named **Main.java**. Double-click to open it.

Replace the existing code with this simple Java class:
```
package org.example;

// Every Java application starts execution from the main method
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // System.out.println is the command to print text to the console.
        System.out.println("Hello, SDET! My Java setup is complete!");
    }
}
```

Click the small green "Play" icon next to the main method declaration.

The console window at the bottom of the screen should display: Hello, SDET! My Java setup is complete!

Congratulations! Your full Java environment is ready for automation.

# Next Steps for a Tester

Once you are set up, your learning path should focus on:

Java Basics: Variables, Data Types, Conditionals (if/else), Loops (for, while).

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java: Classes, Objects, Methods, Inheritance, Polymorphism.

Core Libraries: Understanding String manipulation and using Collections (List, Map, Set).

Test Frameworks: Integrating JUnit/TestNG into your Maven project.

Automation: Adding Selenium or Rest Assured dependencies to your pom.xml and writing your first test!
