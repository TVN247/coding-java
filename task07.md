# Smallest Number with Sum of Digits N and Related Problems

## Problem 1: Sum of Digits
Given an integer number, calculate the sum of all its digits.

### Example 1:
```
Input: num = 12345
Output: 15
Explanation: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: num = 9999
Output: 36
Explanation: 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36
```



Given an integer `N`, find the smallest non-negative integer whose digits sum to `N`.

## Problem 2: Find Smallest Number
### Example 1:
```
Input: N = 16
Output: 79
Explanation: Numbers whose digits sum to 16 include: 79, 97, 808, 565, 22822
Among these, 79 is the smallest.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: N = 19
Output: 199
Explanation: 1 + 9 + 9 = 19
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: N = 7
Output: 7
Explanation: 7 is already the smallest number with digit sum of 7
```

## Constraints:
- 0 ≤ N ≤ 50
- For Problem 2: Input number can be any non-negative integer
